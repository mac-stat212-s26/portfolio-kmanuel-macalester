    "text": "Exercise 2\nNavigate the Geoms section of the ggplot2 reference page to find a geom that corresponds to the visual elements in the temperature plot. Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\ngeom_line, geom_histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotedata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs. Your plot should look like the one below. The hex code of the used light tan color is #ECEBE3.\n\n\nSFO Weather Records in 2011\n\n\nCodeggplot(weather, aes(x = dateInYear, y = RecordHigh)) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = RecordLow, ymax = RecordHigh), fill = \"#ECEBE3\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#ECEBE3\") +\n  geom_line(\n    data = weather,\n    aes(x = dateInYear, y = RecordLow),\n    color = \"#ECEBE3\"\n  ) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipKeyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts. Focus on the following:\n\nInsert code chunk: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows). Option+Command+I (Mac).\nRun current code chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows). Command+Shift+Return (Mac).\nRun current line/currently selected lines: Ctrl+Enter (Windows). Command+Return (Mac).",

Put these files in the data folder of your 04_adv_maps folder.\n\n\nMN cities: https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/loc-pop-centers\n\nFile type: shapefile (.shp)\nFile name: shp_loc_pop_centers.zip (Unzip this after downloading.)\n\n\nMN water: https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-water-lakes-rivers\n\nFile type: shapefile (.shp)\nFile name: shp_water_lakes_rivers.zip (Unzip this after downloading.)\n\n\nRead in Files\n\nRead in the MN cities and MN water shapefiles by entering the correct relative paths in st_read().

Using the class() function we can check the class (type) of object that we just read in. Note the presence of the “sf” and “data.frame” classes:\n\nCodeclass(nc)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_cities)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_water)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhen we read in spatial objects, it is useful to check what CRS underlies the data. We can do that with st_crs() from the sf package:\n\nCodest_crs(nc)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: NAD27 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"NAD27\",\n    DATUM[\"North American Datum 1927\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"Clarke 1866\",6378206.4,294.978698213898,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4267]]\n\n\nWe can treat sf objects similarly to ordinary datasets when using ggplot2 to make spatial visualizations:\n\nCodeggplot(nc) +\n    geom_sf() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    labs(title = \"NAD27\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange CRS\n\nLet’s explore how changing the CRS changes the map. The st_transform() function in sf re-expresses a spatial object using a user-supplied CRS. The crs argument takes a string descriptor of the CRS. We can find these descriptors via https://epsg.io. In the example below, I searched for “South Carolina”.\n\n\nCodenc_transformed &lt;- nc |&gt; st_transform(crs = \"EPSG:32133\")\nst_crs(nc_transformed)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:32133 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"NAD83 / South Carolina\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"NAD83\",\n        DATUM[\"North American Datum 1983\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"GRS 1980\",6378137,298.257222101,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4269]],\n    CONVERSION[\"SPCS83 South Carolina zone (meter)\",\n        METHOD[\"Lambert Conic Conformal (2SP)\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of false origin\",31.8333333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8821]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of false origin\",-81,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8822]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of 1st standard parallel\",34.8333333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8823]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of 2nd standard parallel\",32.5,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8824]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Easting at false origin\",609600,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8826]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Northing at false origin\",0,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8827]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"easting (X)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"northing (Y)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"United States (USA) - South Carolina - counties of Abbeville; Aiken; Allendale; Anderson; Bamberg; Barnwell; Beaufort; Berkeley; Calhoun; Charleston; Cherokee; Chester; Chesterfield; Clarendon; Colleton; Darlington; Dillon; Dorchester; Edgefield; Fairfield; Florence; Georgetown; Greenville; Greenwood; Hampton; Horry; Jasper; Kershaw; Lancaster; Laurens; Lee; Lexington; Marion; Marlboro; McCormick; Newberry; Oconee; Orangeburg; Pickens; Richland; Saluda; Spartanburg; Sumter; Union; Williamsburg; York.\"],\n        BBOX[32.05,-83.36,35.21,-78.52]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",32133]]\n\nCodeggplot(nc_transformed) +\n    geom_sf() +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to use https://epsg.io to find two CRSs that result in a North Carolina map that is noticeably different from the original in the NAD27 CRS.\nTake a look at the function below that re-maps a spatial object using a new CRS.\n\nRead through the function to get a sense for how this code works.\n\nspatial_obj and new_crs are called arguments (function inputs).\n\nAdd one more argument called title to this function.

Below we only plot large cities, and we color and size cities according to their population.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = \"white\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the scale_color_viridis_c() documentation via the ggplot2 reference.\n\nRead the function description at the top. What is the advantage of using this function for making color palettes?\nLook through the examples section. What is the difference between the _d(), _c(), and _b() variants of this function?\n\nAn advantage of using this function for making color palettes is that it is color-blind friendly (for common forms of color-blindness), and the color maps are uniform in black-and-white. The difference between the variants is that they are used for different types of data: _d() is for discrete data, _c() is for continuous data, and _b() is for binning continuous data before mapping.\nAdding Elevation Raster Data\nWhere are large cities located? Is there some relationship to local geography/terrain?\n\nTo investigate these questions, we can obtain elevation data to include on the map using the elevatr package. We encounter two new functions here—we can look up their documentation to make sense of the code by entering the following in the Console:\n\n\n?elevatr::get_elev_raster\n?terra::as.data.frame\n\n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties, z = 5, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nBuild on our existing map by adding a raster layer for elevation as the background.\n\nLook up the documentation for geom_raster() to plot the elevation data from elev_df. This will be the first layer of the plot.\nLook at the documentation for scale_fill_gradient() to add the following elevation color scale: \"darkgreen\" represents the lowest elevations, and \"white\" represents the highest elevations.\nAdd in the layers from the map above to show the largest cities and the county outlines. To remove a background color, use fill = NA.\n\n\nCode# CONTINUE WORKING\nggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x=x, y=y, fill = elevation)) +\n    scale_fill_gradient(\n  low = \"darkgreen\",\n  high = \"white\",\n  guide = \"colourbar\",\n) +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale \n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom in to Twin Cities and Add Water\n\nThe bulk of the interesting information in this map is in the Twin Cities area. Let’s zoom in to this area.\n\n\nWe can use the st_bbox() function to get the bounding box for a spatial object—we do this after filtering to the 7 counties in the Twin Cities.\nWe then use st_crop() to trim a spatial object to a given bounding box.\n\n\nCodeseven_countyarea &lt;- mn_counties |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% c(\"Anoka\", \"Hennepin\", \"Ramsey\", \"Dakota\", \"Carver\", \"Washington\", \"Scott\")) |&gt; \n    st_bbox()\nseven_countyarea\n\n     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax \n 419967.1 4924212.8  521254.8 5029157.4 \n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties |&gt; st_crop(seven_countyarea), z = 9, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nIn the plot below, we add a layer for water information and a coord_sf() layer to restrict the x and y-axis limits to the Twin Cities bounding box. (Without this layer, the map would zoom back out to show all counties and bodies of water).\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") # remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s add to the above code chunk to save the map above to an image file called tc_map_zoom.png in the figures folder. The code example below shows a general template for saving a plot to file. Choose a reasonable width and height. (There are also jpeg() and pdf() functions for writing images.)\n\nCodepng(\"/Users/katiemanuel/Desktop/spring 26/stat212/portfolio-kmanuel-macalester/ica/04_adv_maps/figures/tc_map_zoom.png\", width = 800, height = 400)\nggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") # remove legend \n# Code for creating plot\ndev.off()",
